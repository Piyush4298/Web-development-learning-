        <h1>1.Python</h1>
        <p>
            Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language.<br>
            Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation.<br>
            Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small 
            and large-scale projects.
        </p>
        <h1>2.C++</h1>
        <p>
            C++ (/ˌsiːˌplʌsˈplʌs/) is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the 
            C programming language, or "C with Classes".<br> The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has 
            object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.<br> It is 
            almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software 
            Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.
