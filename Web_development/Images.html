        <p>While commenting on the same, Sandeep Jain, Founder, GeeksforGeeks said, â€œMore than 120 million people have lost their jobs in India in the last 12 months while the new vacancies were also down by 25-28%.
            <br> Keeping this in mind we decided to extend a helping hand to those in need and unlocked the job portal for everyone. More than 200 Companies are listed at GeeksforGeeks Job Portal today, and 10000+ students have already applied for the job through the portal.
            <br> We hope that this will help thousands of others to find their dream job without any hassle
