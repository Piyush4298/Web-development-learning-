        <p class="y">Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language.
            Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation.
            Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small 
            and large-scale projects.</p>
